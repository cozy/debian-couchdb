 claims:
 .
 (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
     distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without

 .
 (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial
     Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the
     Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that

     the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater
     extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
     combinations.
 .
 2.2. Contributor Grant.
 Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
 non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
 claims:
 .
 (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
     distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
     portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
     Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and
 .
 (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor,
     to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but
     solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary
     to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions
     thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to
     Utilize further Modifications or combinations.
 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
 3.1. Application of License.
 The Modifications which You contribute are governed by the terms of
 this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
 Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms
 of this License, and You must include a copy of this License with
 every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
 impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
 the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
 hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering
 the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
 .
 3.2. Availability of Source Code.
 Any Modification which You contribute must be made available in Source
 Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as
 an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
 Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;
 and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must
 remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
 initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
 subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
 available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
 the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
 Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 .
 3.3. Description of Modifications.
 You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a
 file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
 the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
 the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
 Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
 Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
 Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
 origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
 .
 (a) Third Party Claims.
     If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
     right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization
     under this License), you must include a text file with the source
     code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
     the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
     will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You
     make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You
     shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
     available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
     appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
     inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
     been obtained.
 .
 (b) Contributor APIs.
     If Your Modification is an application programming interface and
     You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to
     implement that API, you must also include this information in the
     LEGAL file.
 .
 3.5. Required Notices.
 You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
 Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where
 You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You
 created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
 Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not
 possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to
 its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such
 as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for
 such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
 recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
 behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
 Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
 support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
 and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
 Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
 such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
 liability terms You offer.
 .
 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
 requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
 and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
 the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
 including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
 obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
 in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
 collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
 Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
 Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
 from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
 of this License and that the license for the Executable version does
 not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source
 Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
 distribute the Executable version under a different license You must
 make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
 are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
 Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
 every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
 or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
 .
 3.7. Larger Works.
 You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
 not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
 Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
 requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute
 or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
 to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
 the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
 file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
 distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
 statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
 for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
 attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. CONNECTION TO MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE
 .
 This Erlang License is a derivative work of the Mozilla Public
 License, Version 1.0. It contains terms which differ from the Mozilla
 Public License, Version 1.0.
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
 COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS,
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
 DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
 NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
 THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE
 IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
 CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
 CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
 OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER
 EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
 such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
 sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
 survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
 nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
 shall survive.
 .
 9. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 Any utilization of Covered Code shall not cause the Initial Developer
 or any Contributor to be liable for any damages (neither direct nor
 indirect).
 .
 10. MISCELLANEOUS
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
 matter hereof. If any provision is held to be unenforceable, such
 provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
 enforceable. This License shall be construed by and in accordance with
 the substantive laws of Sweden. Any dispute, controversy or claim
 arising out of or relating to this License, or the breach, termination
 or invalidity thereof, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
 of Swedish courts, with the Stockholm City Court as the first
 instance.

 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
